# ii_ROM Library

The ii_ROM library provides a simple interface for managing ROM (Read-Only Memory) on Arduino devices. It allows you to store and retrieve data in a structured manner, making it useful for storing configuration settings, datasets, and more.

## Features

- Easy-to-use functions for writing and reading data in ROM.
- Support for creating and managing multiple slots within the ROM.
- Checksum-based signature verification to ensure data integrity.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Copy the `ii_ROM` folder into the `libraries` directory in your Arduino sketchbook.

## Getting Started

To use the ii_ROM library in your Arduino sketch, include the header file:

```cpp
#include "ii_ROM.h"
```

Then, create an instance of the `ii_ROM` class and initialize it:

```cpp
ii_ROM rom;
rom.begin(10, 4096); // Specify the size of datasets (10 in this example) and ROM memory size (4096 bytes).
```

## Usage

### Writing Data to a Slot

```cpp
rom.createSlot(0, 32); // Create a slot at index 0 with a length of 32 bytes.
rom.writeSlot("Hello, World!", 0); // Write a String to the created slot.
```

### Reading Data from a Slot

```cpp
String data = rom.readValues(0); // Read data from slot at index 0.
```

### Checking if a Slot is Empty

```cpp
bool isEmpty = rom.isEmpty(0); // Check if slot at index 0 is empty.
```
